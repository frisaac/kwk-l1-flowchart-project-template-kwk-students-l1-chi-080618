  <br>

  <p class="Home">Global organizations estimate that over 35% of women are violently assaulted each year. These experiences can leave scars that can last a lifetime. Imagine how many women could be saved if they were given the skills to fight back against their attackers.</p>
    <p class="Home2">THIS NEEDS TO STOP.</p>
    <p class="Home3">As women in Chicago, we understand how dangerous it can be to even walk home from school. We know that we have to be aware of everything that is going on around us because, even with a pepper spray in our hands, it is not guaranteed we will be safe. Our goal is to keep as many people as safe as possible. We want to fight against this issue and make sure women are well equipped with skills to fight.</p>
    <p class="Home4">It's time to take a stand. It's time to feel safer doing the things we love. Take at least one lesson for self-defense, so you can stay safe.</p>
